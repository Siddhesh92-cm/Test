1st
Now I understand clearly.
You are not just merging files — you are doing hierarchical reconciliation.
You have:
Source 1: MPP export (real project structure)
Source 2: Template (standard expected structure)
You create 3 sets:
✅ Matching tasks
🟡 Template-only
🔴 MPP-only
Then:
Use Template parent structure as primary
If parent missing → create parent
Then insert task under that parent
And now:
Because task names duplicate across hierarchy, your parent lookup breaks
And WBS becomes incorrect
This is a classic tree alignment problem.
🎯 Root Cause (Very Important)
You are probably doing something like:
Python
Copy code
parent_row = df_template[df_template["Task"] == parent_name]
But if "Design" appears 4 times →
Which Design?
Wrong parent gets selected → wrong WBS → broken hierarchy.
So problem is NOT duplicates.
Problem is:
You are using Task Name as identity.
That is fundamentally unstable in hierarchical systems.
Even Microsoft Project never uses task name as identity.
🧠 Correct Way to Solve This (Production-Level Design)
You must stop identifying tasks by:
Task Name
WBS alone
Instead use:
✅ Full Path Identity
Instead of:
Copy code

Task = "Design"
Use:
Copy code

Path = "Project > Phase 1 > Design"
That path is unique.
🔥 Step-by-Step Correct Approach
Step 1 — Build Hierarchical Path for Both Files
From WBS or Level build full path.
Example logic:
Python
Copy code
def build_path(df):
    stack = {}
    paths = []

    for _, row in df.iterrows():
        level = row["Level"]
        task = row["Task"]

        stack[level] = task

        # remove deeper levels
        stack = {k: v for k, v in stack.items() if k <= level}

        full_path = " > ".join([stack[l] for l in sorted(stack)])
        paths.append(full_path)

    return paths
Then:
Python
Copy code
df_template["Path"] = build_path(df_template)
df_mpp["Path"] = build_path(df_mpp)
Now instead of matching by Task Name, match by:
Copy code

Path
Now duplicates are resolved automatically.
✅ Step 2 — Create Unique Key
Python
Copy code
df_template["UID"] = "T_" + df_template.index.astype(str)
df_mpp["UID"] = "M_" + df_mpp.index.astype(str)
Never use name for joins.
✅ Step 3 — Parent Lookup Using Path
If task path is:
Copy code

Project > Phase 1 > Design
Parent path is:
Copy code

Project > Phase 1
So:
Python
Copy code
df["Parent_Path"] = df["Path"].apply(lambda x: " > ".join(x.split(" > ")[:-1]))
Now parent mapping becomes deterministic.
No ambiguity.
🔥 Step 4 — Rebuild WBS AFTER Final Tree Is Built
Do NOT trust original WBS after merge.
Always regenerate WBS fresh from final hierarchy.
Example:
Python
Copy code
def regenerate_wbs(df):
    counters = {}
    wbs = []

    for _, row in df.iterrows():
        level = row["Level"]

        counters[level] = counters.get(level, 0) + 1

        # reset deeper levels
        for k in list(counters.keys()):
            if k > level:
                counters[k] = 0

        current = ".".join(str(counters[l]) for l in sorted(counters) if l <= level and counters[l] > 0)
        wbs.append(current)

    return wbs

df_final["WBS"] = regenerate_wbs(df_final)
Now WBS will always be correct.
🎯 Why Your WBS Is Breaking
Because:
You insert tasks in middle
But you don't renumber whole tree afterward.
WBS is positional numbering.
If tree changes → numbering must be regenerated.
🏗 Architect-Level Summary
You are solving:
Template-guided hierarchical tree reconciliation
Correct pipeline should be:
Build path identity for both files
Compare using path, not name
Build final tree structure
Regenerate Level (if needed)
Regenerate WBS at the end
Export
💡 Very Important Rule
Never:
Merge trees using task name
Trust WBS after structural changes
Insert nodes without renumbering
🚀 If You Want Next Level
Tell me:
Are template and MPP guaranteed to have same top root?
Or can root also differ?
Based on that I can give you exact final merging algorithm tailored to your case.



2nd
Perfect. Now we’ll design this properly — like a real tree system, not Excel scripting.
This will be:
Clean
DSA-correct
Scalable
Production-ready
🎯 Step 1 — Define Proper Tree Node
This is the core abstraction.
Python
Copy code
class TaskNode:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.children = []
        self.parent = None
        self.level = None
        self.wbs = None

    def add_child(self, child):
        child.parent = self
        self.children.append(child)
This is a classic Tree Node.
🎯 Step 2 — Build Tree From Flat Data (Level Based)
Assume dataframe has:
Task
Level
Python
Copy code
def build_tree(df):
    root = TaskNode("ROOT")
    stack = {0: root}

    for _, row in df.iterrows():
        level = row["Level"]
        name = row["Task"]

        node = TaskNode(name)

        parent = stack[level - 1]
        parent.add_child(node)

        stack[level] = node

    return root
This reconstructs tree from flat format.
Time complexity: O(n)
🎯 Step 3 — Create Path-Based Identity Map
Now we assign path while traversing.
Python
Copy code
def build_path_map(node, path="", path_map=None):
    if path_map is None:
        path_map = {}

    if node.name != "ROOT":
        current_path = f"{path}/{node.name}" if path else node.name
        path_map[current_path] = node
    else:
        current_path = ""

    for child in node.children:
        build_path_map(child, current_path, path_map)

    return path_map
Now:
Each node has unique identity:
Copy code

Phase1/Design/UI
No duplicate confusion.
🎯 Step 4 — Merge MPP Tree Into Template Tree
Template is primary.
Logic:
For each node in MPP path_map:
If path exists in template → skip
If not → insert under correct parent
Python
Copy code
def merge_trees(template_root, mpp_root):
    template_map = build_path_map(template_root)
    mpp_map = build_path_map(mpp_root)

    for path, mpp_node in mpp_map.items():
        if path not in template_map:
            parent_path = "/".join(path.split("/")[:-1])
            node_name = path.split("/")[-1]

            parent_node = template_map.get(parent_path)

            if parent_node:
                new_node = TaskNode(node_name)
                parent_node.add_child(new_node)

                # update map
                template_map[path] = new_node

    return template_root
Now hierarchy is clean.
No name-based ambiguity.
🎯 Step 5 — Regenerate Level + WBS Using DFS
Now we rebuild structure properly.
Python
Copy code
def assign_level_and_wbs(node, level=0, prefix=[]):
    if node.name != "ROOT":
        node.level = level
        node.wbs = ".".join(map(str, prefix))

    for i, child in enumerate(node.children, 1):
        assign_level_and_wbs(child, level + 1, prefix + [i])
Call:
Python
Copy code
assign_level_and_wbs(final_root)
This guarantees:
Correct Level
Correct WBS
Always consistent
No dependency on original numbering
🎯 Step 6 — Flatten Tree Back To DataFrame
Python
Copy code
def flatten_tree(node, rows=None):
    if rows is None:
        rows = []

    if node.name != "ROOT":
        rows.append({
            "Task": node.name,
            "Level": node.level,
            "WBS": node.wbs
        })

    for child in node.children:
        flatten_tree(child, rows)

    return rows
Then:
Python
Copy code
final_rows = flatten_tree(final_root)
df_final = pd.DataFrame(final_rows)
🧠 What You Just Built (DSA Perspective)
You implemented:
Tree construction
Tree merge
DFS traversal
Positional encoding
Deterministic hierarchy rebuild
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)
This is clean tree transformation.
🔥 Why This Solves Your Duplicate Problem
Because:
Two "Design" nodes are different objects
They exist in different paths
They never overwrite each other
Parent lookup is path-based
WBS is regenerated fresh
No more ambiguity.
🚀 This Is Architect-Level Implementation
This is no longer:
“Excel comparing script”
This is:
Hierarchical tree reconciliation engine
Which is exactly how structured systems should be designed.
If you want next level:
I can show you how to:
Preserve additional attributes (dates, duration, etc.)
Detect moved tasks
Detect renamed tasks
Log structural conflicts
Just tell me.
